- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
  a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-> No, because title and category have same type, so computer don't know what method will be called

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
-> Pass by value

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
  objects still remain?
-> Because java pass paremeters by value, swap method only swaps the copies of the references, not the original objects.

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
  the title of the JungleDVD changed?
-> Because dvd and jungleDVD reference to an object, dvd change title so the title of this object will be changed.
   When dvd become a new DVD, it will not reference to jungleDVD object, so the title of jungleDVD will not be changed.
