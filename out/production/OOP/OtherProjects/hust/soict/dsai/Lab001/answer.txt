Ex 6.1:
    - if users choose “Cancel”? the "You has chosen "No"." will be printed
    - To customize the options with only "Yes" or "No" you can change the line:
        int option = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null, "Do you want to change to the first class ticket?", null, JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION);
